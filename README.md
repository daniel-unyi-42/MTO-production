There are two Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
1) The first one is a simple example of make-to-stock production planning, implemented in Python's [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) library.
A similar, little more complicated example can be found in PuLP's documentation [here](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/CaseStudies/a_two_stage_production_planning_problem.html).
2) The second one is the implementation of [Mestry's model](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46950381.pdf) for make-to-order production planning, also implemented with [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp).
